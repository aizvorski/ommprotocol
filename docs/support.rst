OMMProtocol is scientific software, funded by public research grants (Spanish MINECO's project ``CTQ2014-54071-P``, Generalitat de Catalunya's project ``2014SGR989`` and research grant ``2017FI_B2_00168``, COST Action ``CM1306``). If you make use of Ommprotocol in scientific publications, please cite it. It will help measure the impact of our research and future funding! A manuscript is in progress and available as a pre-print in ChemRxiv.
